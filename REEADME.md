### 𝙰𝙱𝙾𝚄𝚃

This project was originally inspired by the REST Countries API challenge and built entirely with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I customized and expanded it with new layers of interactivity, presentation, and functionality that reflect both technical depth and creativity.

**Highlights of this version:**
• Fully custom pop-up README introducing the app experience.
• Integrated reference to my Universal Translation API, an open-source project ready to connect with your own database or OpenAI key, letting users anywhere translate web features into their own language.
• Added bottom bar with direct resource links and my professional contact.
• Smooth dark/light mode toggle, region filtering, and real-time country data powered by the REST Countries API.
• Designed for intuitive navigation, clean interface flow, and educational value.

Working on this project strengthened my front-end fundamentals and creative approach to code, showing how a single open-source API can become a global, user-friendly learning tool through design, logic, and vision.
